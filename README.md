# Ribbon

Ribbon is a debug utility plugin for Paper. (Inspired by [chuzume's chuzu_toolbox](https://github.com/Chuzume/Chuzume-s-Toolbox))

*Support Minecraft Version: 1.21.X*.

## Introduction

1. Download the latest version of Ribbon from [GitHub]() or [Modrinth]().
2. Move the downloaded file to the `plugins` folder.
3. Start the server.

## Usage

- Get items by `/ribbon items` or `/ribbon items spawn`.
- Each item can be used by right-clicking on it. How to use the item depends on the item. For details, see the Lore of the item.

### Notes

- Ribbon is a debugging tool. It is not recommended to use it in the production environment for the following reasons.
    - Ribbon is a debugging tool, so its usage is not restricted by permissions (to avoid installing permission management plugin).
    - It includes a function to easily switch OPs, etc.
    - Other functions specialized for debugging are included.
- Events for item use (`PlayerInteractEvent`, etc.) are given low priority so as not to interfere with other plugin processing.
- Ribbon is optimized for Paper. It is not guaranteed to work with other server software such as Spigot.
